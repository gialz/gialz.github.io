Hi! Welcome to my page. Here you'll find projects I'm currently working on, publications and all things academia!

I am a third-year undergraduate student at King’s College London, currently completing my placement year at King’s Forensics within the Department of Analytical, Environmental, and Forensic Sciences. My role is multifaceted: as a laboratory technician in an ISO-accredited lab, I perform DNA analyses for relationship testing and as a client support officer, I assist individuals in organising their tests, both domestically and internationally.

This January, I will begin my research project in canine genetics, focusing on the complexities of convoluted DNA mixtures while utilising bioinformatic tools. Looking ahead, I aim to pursue PhD programs in bioinformatics and computational genetics in the UK or the US, with a particular interest in advancing the understanding of genetic data through innovative computational methods.
