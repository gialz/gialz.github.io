Hi! Welcome to my page. Here you'll find projects I'm currently working on, publications and all things academia!

I am a third-year undergraduate student at King’s College London, currently completing my placement year at King’s Forensics within the Department of Analytical, Environmental, and Forensic Sciences. My role is multifaceted: as a laboratory technician in an ISO-accredited lab, I perform DNA analyses for relationship testing, and as a client support officer, I assist individuals in organizing their tests, both domestically and internationally.

This January, I will begin my research project in canine genetics, focusing on the complexities of convoluted DNA mixtures while utilising bioinformatic tools. Looking ahead, I aim to pursue PhD programs in bioinformatics and computational genetics in the UK or the US, with a particular interest in advancing the understanding of genetic data through innovative computational methods.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
